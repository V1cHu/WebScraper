# WebScraper
A small python script which I wrote for booking movie tickets once it opens. It can be used with any other countdowns as well such as in retail websites.

##Requirements:
1. Python 3
2. Beautiful Soup 4 -> install it by <code>pip install beautifulsoup4</code>

##How to use:

1. Modify the url which you want to scrape.
2. Identify the tag which will contain the item that you want. *Inspect Element :D* 
3. Configure the tag in the script.
4. Set the time for every hit.
5. Run the script <code>python Main.py</code>
